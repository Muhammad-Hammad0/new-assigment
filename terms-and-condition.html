                        <strong>Revision Policy</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>We provide revisions depending on the package you have selected. Customers enjoy the leverage of
                        unlimited free revisions as we revise their websites without any additional charges, provided
                        that the theme and layout remain the same. The Turnaround Time for revision would be 48-72
                        hours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Turn Around Time</strong></p>
                    <p>Website Affinity have a turnaround time of 48-72 hours for most web development services. Note
                        that this is not the complete time frame for a project. It is only the turnaround time for a
                        single iteration of the development stage. Depending on the kind of service, the time required
                        for revisions could vary from a minimum of 48 hours to 72 hours which means two working days.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
                    <p>Website Orders placed or Revisions Requested on a Monday will be delivered by Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>Website Orders placed or Revisions Requested on a Friday will be delivered by the end of the day
                        Tuesday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Refund Policy & Money Back Guarantee</strong></p>
                    <p>In any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after delivery if
                        the initial website design and theme are approved, or a change is requested unless Website
                        Affinity cancels or terminates your contract for a reason other than your breach or
                        non-performance.</p>
                    <p>All refund requests will be fulfilled as per the following arrangement:</p>
                    <p>You can make a request when the initial designs for the website are offered. However, once you
                        approve or request changes in the initial layout, the refund offer becomes void, and the refund
                        request will not be entertained.</p>
                    <p>If the request for a refund is made before the delivery of the initial layout, then you would be
                        eligible for a Full Refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</p>
                    <p>If the request for a refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for a 66% refund (less
                        10% service & processing fee).</p>
                    <p>No refund request will be entertained after 120 hours of your initial layout delivery. However,
                        since we believe in 100% customer satisfaction, you're encouraged to contact us in case of any
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>No refund request will be entertained if you have not taken any action on your order for 30 days
                        after placing your order. However, if you want to reactivate your website order, you will be
                        charged a certain fee depending on your project.</p>
                    <p>No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.</p>
                    <p>During the project, if the client asks for a refund due to a change of mind or any other
                        personal issues, then the client is not eligible for a refund, although we can store credit the
                        amount which he/she can later utilize for another service.</p>
                    <p>For website packages, no refund will be entertained once website development has been completed
                        or once the website has been deployed live.</p>
                    <p>Refund is processed for the orders placed in good faith. When a customer has placed website
                        orders with more than one website agency for the same job with the intention to claim a refund,
                        we do not consider it a good faith. In such a case, we reserve the right to decline a refund
                        request</p>
                    <p>For video animation packages, no refund request will be entertained after the designing of the
                        storyboard.</p>
                    <p>All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. Website Affinity, based on
                        the violation of your user agreement, reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on
                        an individual case-to-case basis.</p>
                    <p>For Website Affinity Custom packages, the refund will be applicable depending on similar terms
                        as it is on the single packages.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you order web design and video animation services and approve the website, you
                        can claim a refund for the video animation service before designing the storyboard only.</p>
                    <p>A refund request will need to have a valid reason to support it, which must qualify against the
                        website brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a layout has not been designed
                        according to the brief, a refund will not be processed; however, further revisions will be
                        provided until complete satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Money back guarantee is for the orders placed in good faith. When a customer has placed website
                        orders with more than one website agency for the same job with the intention to claim a refund,
                        we do not consider it a good faith. In such a case, we reserve the right to decline a refund
                        request.</p>
                    <p>All website jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design and development;
                        therefore, it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get
                        the desired results.</p>
                    <p>100% unique website guarantee entitles you to a re-draw if our developed website is to be found
                        considerably similar to another website that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing
                        website will be merely a coincidence, and Website Affinity will not accept any responsibility or
                        claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to get their website
                        copyrighted.</p>
                    <p>Note: Website Affinity hold all the rights to reject any project or cancel the contract whenever
                        it deems necessary. After the refund, you will not have any rights to use the domain for any
                        purpose; they will be the sole property of Website Affinity. The company will be the rightful
                        owner of the website.</p>
                    <p>Services not related to website services are not eligible for refunds under any circumstances.
                        They are not covered under our 100% money-back guarantee. If such a service is acquired as part
                        of a Package Deal of any kind, it cannot be used to request a refund on the entire package.
                        Examples of such services are as follows:</p>
                    <p>Copyrights Protection Certificates.</p>
                    <p>Website Emails Hosting Services.</p>
                    <p>Website SSL Certificates</p>

                    <p>For services that are not covered under the 100% refund policy, in case of dissatisfaction,
                        Website Affinity management, after reviewing the project, may choose to offer a partial refund
                        to the client.</p>
